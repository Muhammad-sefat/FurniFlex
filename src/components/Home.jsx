          <div className="collapse-content">
            <p>
              The best material depends on the type of furniture and its use.
              Solid wood (like oak, walnut, or teak) is durable and classic for
              most furniture types. MDF is a budget-friendly alternative for
              certain pieces. Metal is ideal for modern, industrial designs,
              while leather or fabric are popular for upholstery in sofas and
              chairs.

            How do I choose the right size furniture for my space?
          </div>
          <div className="collapse-content">
            <p>
              Start by measuring the available space, and account for room to
              move around the furniture comfortably. Use floor plans or tape to
              visualize the furniture's footprint. For small spaces, choose
              multi-functional or modular furniture. Larger rooms can
              accommodate more substantial pieces like sectional sofas or
              oversized tables.

            How do I maintain and clean wooden furniture?
          </div>
          <div className="collapse-content">
            <p>
              To maintain wooden furniture, regularly dust with a soft cloth.
              For deeper cleaning, use a damp cloth followed by a dry one,
              avoiding harsh chemicals. Apply furniture polish or wax
              periodically to protect the wood and restore shine. Keep wood away
              from direct sunlight and moisture to prevent damage.

            What should I look for when buying a sofa?

          <div className="collapse-content">
            <p>
              When buying a sofa, consider the frame, cushions, fabric, and
              size. Look for a sturdy frame made of hardwood, comfortable
              cushions with foam or down filling, and durable, easy-to-clean
              fabric. Measure your space to ensure the sofa fits and suits your
              roomâ€™s style.

            Is assembly required for most furniture?

            <p>
              {" "}
              Many furniture pieces, especially flat-packed ones, require
              assembly. However, some stores or online sellers offer assembly
              services for an additional fee. If assembling yourself, ensure you
              have the necessary tools and follow the instructions carefully to
              avoid damaging the furniture.
